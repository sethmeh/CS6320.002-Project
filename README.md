# Slay the Spire Helper

The objective of this project is to create a chatbot that responds to questions about choices in the game [Slay the Spire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slay_the_Spire). The bot is capable of responding to prompts from the user and making probabalistic decisions on the best course of action for the user to take.
